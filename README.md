# Guardians -  Web3 Social Recovery Dapp



Guardians is a web3 Social Recovery Dapp that allows you to protect your online legacy by safeguarding your access to your web3 account (ERC725 account) in case you lose access to your current wallet or your private key is compromised. 

Guardians Dapp is designed to safeguard your access to your ERC725 account (like Universal Profile and other dapps built on ERC725 template). We do this using LSP11BasicSocialRecovery standard proposed by Lukso developers.
