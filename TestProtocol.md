# üßë‚Äçüî¨ Manual test protocol for DataX üë©‚Äçüî¨



> Keep the following in mind when completing this form:
>
> 1 - The following processes can be completed regularly to identify any issues upon creating a new bug fix or enhanchement. This protocol assumes you have a significant amount of OCEAN token or liquidity to be able to complete all of these tests. If you need ocean visit the <a href="https://faucet.rinkeby.oceanprotocol.com/send?address=0x7c8a5A7c34C8D9Bff143bEf41EaFfaAb8d543c87"> ocean faucet </a>.üß™
>
> 2 - Open your developer tools in your browser and monitor errors during testing. Make a note of any errors and try to identify what is causing it. If it is not being handled properly, raise the concern during standup or reach out on discord to see whether an issue should be opened.üß¨
>
> 3 - These tests do not include previous checks, a checkbox in one test will not appear exactly the same way in another (unless it is a rare scenario or extremely important). Please ensure the <a href="#standards">Standard Checks</a> occur with each transaction, and check back here if something you expected to occur doesn't. Check dev tools for an error issue if you spot something out of the ordinary, then follow directions in B (above).üß≤
>
> 4 - Some tests require you to do things a particular order, or in a particular timeframe. If you miss a checkbox because a notification timed out or something, just make another transaction and test only that one thing.üßÆ
>
> 5 - If you need to open an issue, check there isn't a similar closed issue for the same bug first. If there is just reopen it, comment, and make sure it is in the TODO column in the DataX project board, or assign it to yourself and place it in IN PROGRESS when you work on it.üìê
>
> 6 - If a test requires you to close the Transaction Loader modal before signing the transactions, if there is more than 1 transaction you can proceed with the test as usual if you accidentally sign the first transaction.üî¨
>
> 7 - Each test has a step overview to be read in entirety before completing the steps, or else you will probably miss a checkbox. Read the steps then go through the checkboxes, refer back to the step overview while checking the boxes.ü•º
>
> 8 - This is a pretty thorough set of tests, if you're testing a new feature or bug fix test only the products it affects. (I.E. If you only add code to swap.tsx, only test swap.tsx. If you make changes to the transaction loader modal, test a each place the modal is used.)‚öóÔ∏è
